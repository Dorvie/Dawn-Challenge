# Default Dawn theme with a new custom section

This is the vanilla Dawn theme from Shopify, with a couple added files based on our website:

1. **sections/signup.liquid** A custom section that shows a service tile on it that can be clicked to toggle on and off (it is a checkbox input).

2. **assets/component-signup.css** styles for the signup.liquid file

3. **_res/\*** images that would go in the store's Files
